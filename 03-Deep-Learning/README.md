# Deep Learning & PyTorch

## Overview

This section covers deep learning fundamentals using PyTorch. You'll learn to work with tensors, understand how models learn, write training loops, and grasp key architectures that power modern AI.

## Section Structure

This section contains one project:

### PyTorch Fundamentals
**Location:** `PyTorch-Fundamentals/`

Covers essential deep learning concepts:
- Tensor lifecycle (CPU ↔ GPU)
- Autograd and backpropagation
- Writing training loops
- CNN and Transformer architectures
- Pretraining and fine-tuning
- LoRA/PEFT for efficient adaptation
- Inference vs training

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Tensor Lifecycle** - Understand CPU/GPU operations
2. **Learn Autograd** - How models learn (automatic differentiation)
3. **Write Training Loops** - Core of model training
4. **Study Architectures** - CNN and Transformer
5. **Master Transfer Learning** - Pretraining and fine-tuning

## Prerequisites

- Section 01 completed (Python & Math Fundamentals)
- Section 02 completed (Machine Learning Basics)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Basic ML concepts (overfitting, train/test split)

## Time Estimate

**Part of 3-4 months** (combined with Machine Learning section).

## Key Learning Principles

1. **Hands-on practice:** Write code, don't just read
2. **Understand the fundamentals:** Tensors, gradients, training loops
3. **Architecture intuition:** Know when to use CNN vs Transformer
4. **Production mindset:** Think about inference, not just training

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a GPU?**  
A: Helpful but not required for learning. CPU works for small examples.

**Q: How deep should I go into math?**  
A: Understand the concepts intuitively. You don't need to derive formulas.

**Q: Should I memorize architectures?**  
A: No. Understand the principles (attention, convolution) and you can adapt.

**Q: What about other frameworks?**  
A: PyTorch is industry standard. Concepts transfer to other frameworks.

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll move to:
- **Section 04:** LLM & Generative AI (applies deep learning to language)
