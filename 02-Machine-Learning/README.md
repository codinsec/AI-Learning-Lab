# Machine Learning Basics

## Overview

This section introduces classical machine learning concepts from an AI Engineer's perspective. You'll learn to understand and use ML models effectively, not just train them.

## Section Structure

This section contains one project:

### Classical ML Fundamentals
**Location:** `Classical-ML-Fundamentals/`

Covers essential ML concepts:
- Basic algorithms (regression, trees, random forest)
- Overfitting and underfitting
- ML pipelines
- Train/validation/test split
- Data leakage prevention

## Learning Path

1. **Start with ML Basics** - Understand different algorithms
2. **Learn Overfitting/Underfitting** - Recognize model complexity issues
3. **Master Pipelines** - Organize preprocessing and modeling
4. **Practice Data Splitting** - Avoid data leakage

## Prerequisites

- Section 01 completed (Python & Math Fundamentals)
- Understanding of NumPy and Pandas
- Basic statistics knowledge

## Time Estimate

**Part of 3-4 months** (combined with Deep Learning section).

## Key Learning Principles

1. **Understanding over memorization:** Know why models work, not just how
2. **Production mindset:** Think about deployment from the start
3. **Avoid data leakage:** Always split data before preprocessing
4. **Evaluate correctly:** Use proper train/validation/test splits

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to become a data scientist?**  
A: No. You need to understand ML concepts to use them in AI systems.

**Q: How deep should I go?**  
A: Deep enough to understand when to use which algorithm and how to evaluate them.

**Q: What about feature engineering?**  
A: Understand the concept, but in modern AI, embeddings often replace manual feature engineering.

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll move to:
- **Section 03:** Deep Learning & PyTorch (continues the ML journey)
