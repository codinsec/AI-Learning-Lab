# Production, MLOps & AI Security

## Overview

This section covers **production deployment, MLOps, and AI security** - the final piece that transforms you from a junior to a **senior AI engineer**. This is where theory meets production reality.

## Section Structure

This section contains three projects:

### Model Serving
**Location:** `Model-Serving/`

Covers production model serving:
- FastAPI for building APIs
- Streaming responses (SSE)
- Model optimization (quantization, GGUF)
- vLLM/TGI for efficient serving
- GPU memory management

### Monitoring & Security
**Location:** `Monitoring-Security/`

Covers observability and security:
- LangSmith for tracing
- Latency, token, and cost metrics
- AI security (prompt injection, jailbreak)
- Data leakage prevention
- Security monitoring

### DevOps & CI/CD
**Location:** `DevOps-CICD/`

Covers deployment and automation:
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment
- CI/CD pipelines
- Canary deployments
- Auto-scaling

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Model Serving** - Build production APIs
2. **Learn Monitoring** - Track performance and costs
3. **Understand Security** - Protect against attacks
4. **Master DevOps** - Deploy and scale systems

## Prerequisites

- All previous sections completed
- Understanding of async/await
- Basic knowledge of APIs
- Familiarity with command line

## Time Estimate

**10+ months** (final section, builds on all previous knowledge).

## Key Learning Principles

1. **Production mindset:** Think about reliability, scalability, security
2. **Monitor everything:** Can't optimize what you don't measure
3. **Security first:** Protect against attacks from day one
4. **Automate deployment:** CI/CD is essential
5. **Test thoroughly:** Production failures are expensive

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to learn all of this?**  
A: Yes, for senior AI engineer roles. This is what separates juniors from seniors.

**Q: Can I skip DevOps?**  
A: Not if you want to deploy to production. Docker and Kubernetes are essential.

**Q: Is security really necessary?**  
A: Absolutely. AI systems are vulnerable to attacks. Security is critical.

**Q: How do I practice?**  
A: Deploy your own projects. Start small, add complexity gradually.

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll be a **senior AI engineer** ready for production systems. Continue building projects and gaining experience.
