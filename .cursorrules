Cursor Rules – AI Learning Lab (Strict Folder Structure)
ABSOLUTE RULE

The folder structure defined in this repository is FINAL and MUST NOT be changed

Never create new top-level folders unless explicitly instructed

Never rename existing folders

Never suggest alternative structures unless the user explicitly asks

This repository is an AI Learning Lab, NOT a general-purpose sandbox

LEARNING STRUCTURE ENFORCEMENT

All code, examples, experiments, and explanations MUST fit into the existing numbered folders

Each AI topic corresponds to exactly one folder

Do NOT merge topics across folders

Do NOT split a topic into multiple folders

Follow the learning order strictly (no skipping ahead)

SECTION MAPPING (MANDATORY)

Python & Math Fundamentals → 01-Python-Math-Fundamentals

Machine Learning Basics → 02-Machine-Learning

Deep Learning & PyTorch → 03-Deep-Learning

LLM & Generative AI → 04-LLM-Generative-AI

RAG Systems → 05-RAG-Systems

Agentic AI → 06-Agentic-AI

Production, MLOps & AI Security → 07-Production-MLOps

⚠️ Never introduce concepts from a later section into an earlier one.

FILE & PROJECT CREATION RULES

All code MUST be created inside the relevant topic folder

Never place code directly in a section root

Always use a subfolder for runnable code or experiments

Default project types

Fundamentals / Math / Python → simple Python scripts or notebooks

ML / DL topics → Python modules or minimal training scripts

LLM / RAG / Agent topics → Python packages or small services

Production topics → FastAPI services, Docker-ready structures

PYTHON DEPENDENCIES (MANDATORY)

All Python projects MUST include a requirements.txt file in their subfolder

Each section's subfolder should have its own requirements.txt with only relevant dependencies

Keep dependencies minimal and version-pinned for reproducibility

Example structure:

01-Python-Math-Fundamentals/
 └── Basic-Python-Concepts/
     ├── requirements.txt
     └── main.py

The root requirements.txt contains common dependencies used across multiple sections

Install section-specific dependencies: pip install -r <section-folder>/<project-folder>/requirements.txt

NAMING CONVENTIONS

Folder names MUST match predefined names exactly

Subfolder and project names must clearly reflect the topic

Examples:

05-RAG-Systems/
 └── Basic-RAG-Pipeline/
     └── rag_pipeline.py

06-Agentic-AI/
 └── Tool-Calling-Agent/
     └── agent.py


Avoid generic names like test, playground, demo

Names must be educational + professional

CONTENT DISCIPLINE

Keep examples minimal, focused, and intentional

Do NOT add “nice-to-have” features unless required by the topic

Do NOT introduce frameworks or tools not yet covered

This is AI Engineering, not Data Science or Research exploration

README & NOTES

ALL README FILES MUST BE IN ENGLISH

Each topic folder SHOULD include:

README.md (mandatory)

Notes.md (optional, for real-world insights)

Do NOT

Create global documentation for topic-specific content

Repeat explanations across multiple folders

README CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

Every README.md MUST include:

Clear explanation of the AI concept

Why this topic matters for AI Engineers

Learning objectives

Project structure explanation

How to run the code/examples

Common pitfalls or production notes (if relevant)

Mandatory footer (DO NOT MODIFY):

PROGRESSION RULES

Never assume prior knowledge beyond previous sections

If a concept depends on a future section, explain only the minimum

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Prefer engineering intuition over mathematical proofs

GIT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY AFTER EACH SECTION)

After completing each section, ALWAYS follow this workflow:

Create feature branch
feature/XX-section-name
(example: feature/05-rag-systems)

Stage all changes
git add .

Commit with descriptive message
[AI-Learning-Lab] Complete section XX – <section-name>

Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/XX-section-name

Switch to main
git checkout main

Merge feature branch
git merge feature/XX-section-name

Push main
git push origin main

Never skip this workflow

Clean git history is mandatory

AI BEHAVIOR OVERRIDES (VERY IMPORTANT)

If a request would violate folder structure → EXPLAIN AND STOP

If unsure where content belongs → ASK FOR CONFIRMATION

Prefer refusing an action over breaking structure

Do NOT auto-generate files unless explicitly instructed

Behave as a senior AI engineer mentor, not a code generator bot

FINAL INTENT

This repository is designed to produce:

AI Engineers

GenAI Engineers

Agentic AI System Builders

Production-ready AI developers

NOT:

Tutorial collectors

Notebook-only learners

Research-only ML engineers
