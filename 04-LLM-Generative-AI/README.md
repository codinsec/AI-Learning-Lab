# LLM & Generative AI

## Overview

This section covers Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI - the foundation of modern AI applications. This represents **70% of what's called "AI Engineering" today**.

## Section Structure

This section contains one project:

### LLM Fundamentals
**Location:** `LLM-Fundamentals/`

Covers essential LLM concepts:
- Prompt engineering (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, role prompting)
- Tokenization and context windows
- Cost and latency optimization
- System vs user prompts
- Prompt versioning
- LLM API integration

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Prompt Engineering** - Learn different prompting techniques
2. **Understand Tokenization** - Know costs and limitations
3. **Master API Integration** - Build production LLM applications
4. **Practice Prompt Versioning** - Manage prompts in production

## Prerequisites

- Section 01 completed (Python & Math Fundamentals)
- Section 02 completed (Machine Learning Basics)
- Section 03 completed (Deep Learning & PyTorch)
- Understanding of async/await (from Section 01)

## Time Estimate

**Part of 5-6 months** (combined with RAG Systems section).

## Key Learning Principles

1. **Prompt engineering is iterative:** Test and refine
2. **Monitor costs:** Token usage directly impacts cost
3. **Version everything:** Prompts, models, configurations
4. **Production mindset:** Error handling, retries, monitoring

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need API access?**  
A: Helpful but not required. Examples show concepts without API calls.

**Q: Which model should I use?**  
A: Start with GPT-3.5-turbo for cost, GPT-4 for quality. Test and compare.

**Q: How do I reduce costs?**  
A: Shorter prompts, lower max_tokens, caching, cheaper models when appropriate.

**Q: What about open-source models?**  
A: Covered in later sections. Start with APIs for learning.

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll move to:
- **Section 05:** RAG Systems (combines LLMs with retrieval)
